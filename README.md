# Emotion Detection from Tweets using SVM

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify emotions expressed in English-language tweets using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. The dataset consists of Twitter messages, each labeled with one of six basic emotions: **anger**, **fear**, **joy**, **love**, **sad**, and **surprise**.

## Project Goals

- Preprocess tweet data (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization).
- Train an SVM classifier to predict the emotion associated with a tweet.
- Compare different SVM kernel functions (**linear**, **polynomial**, **RBF**, etc.) to determine which provides the best performance.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle:

**Sample Format:**

| text                            | emotion   |
|----------------------------------|-----------|
| i feel awesome                   | joy       |
